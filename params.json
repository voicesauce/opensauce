{"name":"OpenSauce","tagline":"GNU Octave-compatible version of VoiceSauce","body":"# OpenSauce\r\n\r\nOpenSauce is a MATLAB-free edition of [VoiceSauce](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/spapl/voicesauce/), software for automated voice measurements, which is compatible with GNU Octave (knock on wood). More documentation to come.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n* [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)\r\n* Currently, OpenSauce only works on Mac OSX (tested on Mountain Lion)\r\n* You may need to install [Tcl/Tk](http://www.activestate.com/activetcl)\r\n\r\n## Running OpenSauce on a batch of *.wav files\r\n1. Check settings/getSettings.m\r\n2. Check params/getParameters.m\r\n3. Check settings/getOutputSettings.m\r\n4. Use the command:\r\n\r\n\t$ octave -qf sauce.m [wavdir] [matdir]\r\n\r\n\tWhere [wavdir] is the directory where your *.wav files are stored and [outdir] is the directory where you'd like VoiceSauce to store the resulting *.mat files. \"-qf\" suppresses the Octave startup message.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE that [wavdir] and [matdir] need to be absolute paths (e.g. \"/Users/johndoe/wavfiles\" or \"~/wavfiles\" rather than \"../wavfiles\").\r\n\r\nThe command above carries out all calculations specified in getParameters.m and then runs OutputToText on the resulting *.mat files.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
