{"name":"OpenSauce","tagline":"GNU Octave-compatible version of VoiceSauce","body":"# OpenSauce\r\n\r\nThis version of [VoiceSauce](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/spapl/voicesauce/) is compatible with GNU Octave, knock on wood. More documentation to come.\r\n\r\n## Running OpenSauce on *.wav files\r\n\r\n1. Check settings/getSettings.m\r\n2. Check params/getParameters.m\r\n3. Check settings/getOutputSettings.m\r\n4. Use the command\r\n\r\n\t$ octave -qf sauce.m [wavdir] [matdir]\r\n\r\n\tWhere [wavdir] is the directory where your *.wav files are stored and [outdir] is the directory where you'd like VoiceSauce to store the resulting *.mat files. \"-qf\" suppresses the Octave startup message.\r\n\r\nThe command above carries out all calculations specified in getParameters.m and then runs OutputToText on the resulting *.mat files.\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n* STRAIGHT doesn't work (because it relies on p files)\r\n* Calculating \"H1, H2, H3\" takes a very long time\r\n* Resampling to 16 kHz is not yet implemented\r\n* Outputting to text with \"useSegments = 0\" (i.e. complete dump without segments) takes a very long time\r\n* Octave may throw some warnings that you wouldn't see if you were using MATLAB. Running Octave with the \"--braindead\" option helps some.\r\n\r\n## Folder structure\r\n* vs-octave\r\n\t* sauce.m - script that runs batch_process then OutputToText\r\n\t* algos/ - folder where all of the measurement algorithms are stored\r\n\t\t* wrappers/ - interfaces into each of the measurement methods stored here (e.g. doStraight.m, etc.)\r\n\t\t* functions/ - implementations of each of the measurement methods stored here (e.g. func_getStraight.m, etc.)\r\n\t* optim-1.2.2/ - source code for a slightly-modified version of Octave's optim package (for fminsearch.m, etc.)\r\n\t* bin/ - folder where VoiceSauce.m and other executables are stored; main interface into the program\r\n\t* params/ - folder where parameter files are stored\r\n\t* settings/ - folder where settings files are stored\r\n\t* sys/ - folder where main functions are stored (batch_process.m, OutputToText.m)\r\n\t\t* helpers/ - misc helper functions\r\n\t\t* MacOS/ - just has the Praat binary (used in PraatPitch and Praat Formants)\r\n\t\t* Windows/ - stores *.praat scripts used for PraatPitch and Praat Formants. may want to move somewhere else later.\r\n\t* tests/ - tests for main pieces of functionality","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
