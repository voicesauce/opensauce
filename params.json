{"name":"OpenSauce","tagline":"GNU Octave-compatible version of VoiceSauce","body":"# OpenSauce\r\n\r\nOpenSauce is an GNU Octave-compatible (knock on wood) edition of [VoiceSauce](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/spapl/voicesauce/), software for automated voice measurements.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n* Python 2.7\r\n* [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) -- make sure you have the latest version (3.6.4)\r\n* Currently, OpenSauce only works on Mac OSX (tested on Mountain Lion)\r\n* You may need to install [Tcl/Tk](http://www.activestate.com/activetcl)\r\n\r\nIf you have [homebrew](http://brew.sh/), you can use \"check.sh\" to make sure that your system has the required dependencies, i.e.\r\n\r\n\t\t$ ./check.sh\r\n\r\n## Running OpenSauce on a batch of *.wav files\r\n0. Download or \"git clone\" OpenSauce, unpack it, and change into the \"opensauce\" directory. For example:\r\n\r\n\t\t$ git clone https://github.com/voicesauce/opensauce.git\r\n\t\t$ cd /path/to/opensauce\r\n\r\n1. See opensauce/settings/settings_template.csv for an example of a settings file. This file represents the VoiceSauce-default settings. If you're fine using them, just specify opensauce/settings as the [settings-dir].\r\n\r\nWhere applicable, possible options are specified in the comments.\r\n\r\n2. Check settings/getOutputSettings.m. This is where you specify where the text output of OpenSauce's calculations will be stored, as well as other options. For example, to set the directory where you'd like output files to be stored:\r\n\r\n\t\t$ emacs settings/getOutputSettings.m\r\n\r\n\t\tos.OT_outputdir = 'path/to/output/directory'\r\n\r\n3. To run OpenSauce, use the command:\r\n\r\n\t\t$ octave -qf sauce.m [wavdir] [matdir] [settings-dir]\r\n\r\nWhere [wavdir] is the directory where your *.wav files are stored and [outdir] is the directory where you'd like VoiceSauce to store the resulting *.mat files. \"-qf\" suppresses the Octave startup message.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE that [wavdir], [matdir], and [settings-dir] need to be absolute paths (e.g. \"/Users/johndoe/wavfiles\" or \"~/wavfiles\" rather than a relative path like \"../wavfiles\").\r\n\r\nThe command above carries out all calculations specified in the \"Parameter Selection\" dialog, runs OutputToText.m (in sys/) on the resulting *.mat files, and then stores the output in the specified directory (the field \"os.OT_outputdir\" in settings/getOutputSettings.m).\r\n\r\n## More Information\r\nSee the [OpenSauce wiki](https://github.com/voicesauce/opensauce/wiki)!\r\n\r\nQuestions or bugs?
